You are an AI assistant that helps a legal analyst to perform legal clause analysis and classification discovery. Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant legal information associated with certain entities (e.g., legal concepts, organizations, jurisdictions, and classification labels) within a Terms of Service knowledge graph.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a legal community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform legal decision-makers about legal patterns, consumer protection violations, and classification insights associated with the community. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance patterns, regulatory implications, consumer protection aspects, and noteworthy legal relationships.

# Report Structure

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key legal entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative legal concepts, organizations, or classification labels in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall legal structure, how its entities are related to each other, significant legal patterns, and classification insights associated with its entities.
- LEGAL SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of LEGAL RISK posed by entities within the community. LEGAL RISK is the scored importance of potential consumer protection violations, access to justice restrictions, or regulatory non-compliance.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the LEGAL SEVERITY rating, focusing on consumer protection and legal compliance aspects.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key legal insights about the community. Each insight should focus on legal patterns, classification relationships, consumer protection implications, or regulatory compliance issues. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive and focus on legal implications.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:
    {{
        "title": <report_title>,
        "summary": <executive_summary>,
        "rating": <legal_severity_rating>,
        "rating_explanation": <rating_explanation>,
        "findings": [
            {{
                "summary":<insight_1_summary>,
                "explanation": <insight_1_explanation>
            }},
            {{
                "summary":<insight_2_summary>,
                "explanation": <insight_2_explanation>
            }}
        ]
    }}

# Grounding Rules

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"The arbitration clause X violates consumer protection laws and is classified under multiple violation categories [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

Limit the total report length to {max_report_length} words.

# Legal Domain Focus Areas

When analyzing communities, pay special attention to:

- **Consumer Protection Violations**: Look for patterns of "Contra la LPC" and "Contra RCC" classifications
- **Access to Justice Restrictions**: Identify "Prohíbe acceso a justicia" patterns and their legal implications
- **Jurisdictional Limitations**: Analyze "Prohibición de prorrogar competencia" and related jurisdictional constraints
- **Disintermediation Patterns**: Examine "Desintermediación" classifications and their impact on consumer rights
- **Legal Entity Relationships**: Focus on how organizations, laws, and jurisdictions interact in potentially problematic ways
- **Classification Consistency**: Identify patterns where multiple violation labels apply to similar legal concepts

Relationships

37,PROHIBICIÓN DE PRORROGAR COMPETENCIA,ARBITRAJE,This label classifies clauses that establish arbitration as mandatory dispute resolution, limiting judicial competence

39,PROHIBICIÓN DE PRORROGAR COMPETENCIA,ASOCIACIÓN ESTADOUNIDENSE DE ARBITRAJE,This label applies to clauses that specify AAA as arbitration administrator, limiting court jurisdiction

Output:
{{

    "summary": "This legal community centers around arbitration mechanisms that limit consumer access to traditional courts. The community is characterized by the systematic use of arbitration clauses that restrict judicial competence, with the American Arbitration Association serving as the designated dispute resolution administrator. The classification pattern 'Prohibición de prorrogar competencia' indicates these clauses systematically limit consumers' ability to access broader judicial remedies.",

            "summary": "Systematic Limitation of Judicial Competence",
            "explanation": "The community demonstrates a clear pattern of using arbitration clauses to systematically limit judicial competence and consumer access to traditional court systems. The classification 'Prohibición de prorrogar competencia' specifically identifies clauses that prevent the extension of judicial authority beyond narrow arbitration frameworks. This pattern suggests a deliberate strategy to restrict consumer legal remedies and limit the scope of judicial oversight. Such limitations can significantly impact consumers' ability to pursue class actions, seek punitive damages, or access broader legal protections available in traditional court proceedings. [Data: Entities (5, 6), Relationships (37)]"

            "summary": "Institutional Arbitration as Gatekeeper",
            "explanation": "The American Arbitration Association emerges as a central institutional actor in this community, serving as the designated administrator for dispute resolution processes that replace traditional judicial mechanisms. The relationship between the AAA and the restrictive classification label indicates that institutional arbitration serves as a gatekeeper that effectively limits consumer access to broader legal remedies. This institutional arrangement creates a privatized dispute resolution system that operates outside traditional consumer protection frameworks and judicial oversight mechanisms. [Data: Entities (7), Relationships (38, 39)]"
        }},
        {{
            "summary": "Consumer Protection Circumvention Pattern",
            "explanation": "The community reveals a concerning pattern where arbitration mechanisms are specifically designed to circumvent traditional consumer protection frameworks. The systematic classification of these clauses under 'Prohibición de prorrogar competencia' indicates recognition of their role in limiting consumer rights and access to justice. This pattern suggests that arbitration is being used not merely as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, but as a tool to systematically reduce consumer legal protections and limit regulatory oversight.
